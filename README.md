## Overview
This is an NFT card component built to be reuseable multiple times on a single page, should a developer choose to inject dynamic content.

## My process
- Read project README
- Download project starter files
- Initialize an empty local repo, create a remote repo, and make an initial commit/push
- Make frequent, short, highly-descriptive commit messages
- Set the project up to be hosted live on GitHub pages
- Hand-draw a rough mockup of the page, labeling all elements and their containers, to better visualize the HTML structure and potential classes/ids required
- Build out the semantic HTML structure according to my mockup
- Begin styling with background and largest container elements first
- Style remaining static content top-to-bottom
- Add any required active states to the appropriate elements
- Shrink viewport to mobile breakpoint and add media queries for responsiveness if required


### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Flexbox


### What I learned
- Reinforced theoretical knowledge of HTML and CSS through practice
